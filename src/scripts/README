plot_histogram.py

A python script to parse MultiNest or bootstrapped output and plot
histograms using matplotlib.pyplot.hist().  The script distinguishes
between these two data sources by looking for 'multinest' or 'bootstrap'

will be plotted as a histogram.

Usage:
python plot_histogram.py filename.txt
